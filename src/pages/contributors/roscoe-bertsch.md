bio: >-
  Roscoe created Lonestar Adventure Cast based off a cruddy podcast he and his
  friend Chris did in college. Roscoe wanted to take it a step further and
  develop a platform that can be used to showcase how great Texas is and the
  recreation community that thrives within it's limited public use lands. When
  not working Lonestar Adventure, Roscoe is probably bumming it around Texas, or
  other states (who knows), trying to figure out life like the rest of us
  wannabe dirtbags.
